/* gameMode.h
   A gameMode describes the current state of the game, such as the
   load mission screen, at a mission, at base etc... When a gamemode
   is active it is used for the rendering of the display and it receives
   all input events. Gamemodes can activate other gamemode's and/or return
   to previous gamemodes. (Use with care - can be unintuitive to users)
